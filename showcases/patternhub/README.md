# DB PatternHub

This is a scaffold next.js app for documentation and testing of components.

## How to use this?

Add your documentation under `/pages` folder.

You can use simple folder structure to structure your pages and subpages.

You can use `.tsx` or `.mdx` files to write your documents (see the examples).

As root file for a subfolder you should name it `index.[mdx|tsx]`.

After you add a new subfolder or page you need to update the routes for the navigation under `/data/routes.tsx`.

### Github-Version-Switcher

If you like a version-switcher for GitHub you can change the `.env` file and activate it.
