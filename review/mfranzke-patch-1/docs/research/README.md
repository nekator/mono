# How to research

If you want to do a research for a new component run this in the `docs` folder:

```shell
npm run generate:component-research
```

1. Add the name of your component and a new `.md` file will be created.
2. Use all links to the design systems to check if the component exists and/or if it has another name. Change the link/name according to this.
3. You can add a comment as an optional field if you find something special in another design system.
4. Add a conclusion at the end, which covers similarities and possible problems
