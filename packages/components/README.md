A library containing all styles for components of [DB UX Design System v3](https://github.com/db-ui/mono).

> **Note**
> Furthermore we currently support these additional JavaScript frameworks, with more coming soon:

-   [Angular components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@db-ui/ngx-components)
-   [React components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@db-ui/react-components)
-   [Vue components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@db-ui/v-components)

Please take a look at your desired framework to retrieve more information.

For additional information besides the frameworks see our [Getting started](https://github.com/db-ui/mono/tree/main/packages/components/docs/getting-stated.md).

If you just need the styling follow this:

## Install

`npm i @db-ui/components`

## Dependencies

Import the styles in `scss` or `css`. Based on your technology the file names could be different.

-   Default (db-ui-42): asset path point to `../assets`
-   Webpack (db-ui-42-webpack): asset path point to `~@db-ui/foundations/assets`
-   Rollup (db-ui-42-rollup): asset path point to `@db-ui/foundations/assets`

`db-ui-42` bundles all dependencies from [foundations](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@db-ui/foundations) + all [components](https://github.com/db-ui/mono/blob/main/packages/components/src/styles/db-ui-components.scss) available.

**SCSS**

```scss
// index.scss
@forward "@db-ui/components/build/styles/db-ui-42-rollup";
```

**CSS**

Within HTML files directly:

```html
<!-- index.html //-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/db-ui-42.css" />
```

Or within your JavaScript files, with the related bundler as a prefix (in this case rollup and equivalents like Vite):

```js
// main.js
import "@db-ui/components/build/styles/db-ui-42-rollup.css";
```

### Optimize dependencies

If you only need some of the components or some features from [`@db-ui/foundations`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@db-ui/foundations), you shouldn't include `db-ui-42`.
In the case you want to include only some components, and you could do it like this:

```css
/* The theme contains all prop required for components like spacings, colors, ... */
@import "@db-ui/foundations/build/css/default-theme.css";
/* The font include uses default font families based on your bundling paths (relative, absolute, webpack, rollup) */
@import "@db-ui/foundations/build/css/fonts/include-rollup.css";
/* The required styles will normalize css and add focus and default font to body */
@import "@db-ui/foundations/build/css/init/required.css";
/* The default root adds a default color space (neutral) and a density (regular) */
@import "@db-ui/foundations/build/css/init/default-root.css";

/* Optional: Add animations / transitions for components */
@import "@db-ui/components/build/styles/component-animations.css";

/* Optional: Add data-icon/data-icon-after to global attributes to enable icons for components */
@import "@db-ui/foundations/build/css/icons/include-rollup.css";

/* Optional: Add components */
@import "@db-ui/components/build/components/button/button.css";
@import "@db-ui/components/build/components/input/input.css";
```
