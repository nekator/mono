# How to research

If you want to do a research for a new component run this in the `docs` folder:

```shell
npm run generate:component-research -w=@db-ui/docs
```

1. Add the name of your component and a new `.md` file will be created.
2. Use all links to the design systems to check if the component exists and/or if it has another name. Change the link/name according to this.
3. You can add a comment as an optional field if you find something special in another design system.
4. Add a conclusion at the end, which covers similarities and possible problems

5. Additionally it might be beneficial to even also already save your HTML explorations within the related components file, like e.g. for `buttons`: `packages/components/src/components/button/index.html`
