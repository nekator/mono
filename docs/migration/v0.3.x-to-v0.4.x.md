## Automate migration via CLI

We provide a cli tool to auto migrate your source code. Use this command in your repository:

```shell
npx @db-ui/foundations migration --src=./src
```

Please check the changes made in your codebase afterwards, as this is mainly a simple search & replace and there might be unexpected changes of similar wordings to our icon names for any other methods, or further code occurrences that don't even refer to icons.
